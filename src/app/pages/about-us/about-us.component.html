        <p>In the year 2287 Bob’s Computer Repair Shop began their steps to setup shop in Vault 450.  
            Robert Ghouls (Bob), his wife, and their kids began to enjoy their new life underground.  
            Prior to setting up shop, the family had owned a smaller repair station called Echo.  
            Echo became one of the best known shops known for selling old technology and hardware on 
            the black market.  </p>
        <br />
        <p>What their customers didn’t know was a majority of their sales at that 
            time came from selling ancient alien technology the family had been collecting over the years 
            from time travel.  Robert’s wife Lilith was an engineer of her own.  She had created a time 
            machine originally to stop the rich from taking all technology for themselves.  Back in 1997
            just as computers were starting to be relevant, Lilith and her team took to the time line to make 
            technology open to for all.</p>
        <br />
        <p>As the years came and went, the Ghoul's family's big turning point was the nuclear devastation that 
            occurred in 2019.  This event was life changing for all of America as everyone was pushed 
            underground to live in hiding.  Robert and his family began a new strategy to live and 
            joined the world in becoming technical experts in every field possible.  Lilith became an 
            expert in robotics and soon was one of the best known mechanics underground.  As word passed 
            through the millions of vaults, the Ghoul’s family was able to reopen shop.  Being so versed 
            in old and new technology, the family was able to open Bob’s Computer Repair Shop and strive 
            for new goals.</p>
