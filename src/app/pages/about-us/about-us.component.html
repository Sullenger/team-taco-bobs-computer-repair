            <p>In the year 2287 Bob’s Computer Repair Shop began setup in Vault 450.  Robert Ghouls 
                (who went by ‘Bob’ while completing business related sales) and his wife and kids 
                set off to start their new life.  Prior to setting up shop, the family had owned a 
                smaller repair station ‘ECHO’, selling old technology and hardware on the black market.  
                A majority of their sales at that time came from selling ancient alien technology the
                family had been collecting for years.  The big turning point in Robert’s career was the
                nuclear devastation that occurred in 2077.  This event was life changing for all of America
                as everyone was pushed underground to live in hiding.</p>
                <br />
            <p>Robert and his family began a new strategy to live and joined the world in becoming bandits.  
                Robert’s wife Lilith became an expert in robotics and soon was one of the best known mechanics 
                underground.  As word passed through the millions of vaults, the Ghoul’s family decided to 
                open up shop.  Being so versed in old and new technology, the family was able to thrive enough 
                to not have to make a living through bounties and thieving.</p>
