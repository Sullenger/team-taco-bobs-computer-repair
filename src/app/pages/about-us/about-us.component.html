            <p> Dad,
                <br />
                <br>
                I don't feel I was particularly honest as a child. I did get in trouble when I was younger more often
                then I
                would like to admit but that eventually allowed me to join you in your favorite hobby. I know you
                brought me
                along so I would stay out of trouble but watching you work on electronics really inspired me, even
                though I
                pretended I didn’t care. Over those years I grow to enjoy building, breaking, and tuckering with all
                sorts
                of electrons with you. Those really were some of best years of my life, so far.
                <br />
                <br>
                As you know, I have been out of school long enough to know what I want to do with my life.
                Now that I have grow and experienced some of the world, I am writing you this letter to ask an important
                question. I want to ask you if you would join me by opening a computer repair store with me. Before you
                answer, I do have a small condition. I would like to name the shop after you. You have inspired me and
                encouraged me for as long as I can remember. Now I would like to make you proud (and mom, of course).
                <br />
                <br>
                Hopefully this letter with arrive before I do but I know you will be proud of me regardless of what you
                decide. I can’t wait to see you and mom and have some of delicious apple pie.
                <br />
                <br>
                Your son,
            </p>
